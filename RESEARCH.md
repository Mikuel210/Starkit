	- The rear propeller in general requires a greater blade pitch compared to that of the front propeller, because the rear propeller works in the wake generated by the front propeller and therefore needs more torque
	- More spacing leads to way more thrust in open counter-rotating propellers. However it can lead to less after a certain point in ducted propellers.

	- The propeller and the duct should be made for operating as a ducted propeller

	- If the clearance is below 5% of the blade height (0.25mm for 5mm), a duct doesn't provide any significant efficiency benefit
	- Certain types of propeller minimize the effect of vortices
	- An airfoil shape can improve air circulation and make it a constant speed

	- A ducted fan will stabilize itself

	- The more separation between 2 propellers in series, the more thrust they will produce

	- Counter rotating propellers are about 80% the efficiency of side by side propellers. However, making the separation higher could mitigate this.
