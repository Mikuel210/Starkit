I've identified the reason of making this project to be the following:
> To learn, have fun and to make something that I'm proud of by building an electric model rocket capable of lifting off, hovering and landing propulsively.

With this project, I also hope to:
- Learn avionics and PCB design
- Learn software, communication and control systems
- Learn rocket design
- Learn CAD and project planning

## Design requirements
These are the absolute musts that a design should have:

- The rocket is powered by electric propulsion for cheap and safe flights and fast turnarounds
- The rocket uses thrust vectoring to lift off, hover and land propulsively
- The rocket can perform a 1 meter hop and hover for 30 seconds
- - The rocket is modular
	- Components are easily accessible and replaceable
	- The rocket is designed for a future launchpad integration
		- The rocket has got detachable landing legs and attachable catch pins
		- The pad should be able to hold the rocket until full throttle is reached

## Dream goals
These are not essential but they'd be cool to have:

- The rocket can perform a 10 meter hop
- The rocket can hover for a minute
- The rocket looks as cool as possible
