## May 22: Initial ideas and goal of the project

I always like to begin engineering projects by setting a goal. For this project, my goal is the following:
> To learn, have fun and to make something that I'm proud of by building an electric model rocket capable of lifting off, hovering and landing propulsively.

I want to build a fully reusable vehicle capable of landing propulsively through thrust vector control. If the rocket is capable of performing a 1 meter hop and hover for 30 seconds, I will consider it a success.

Based on my vision for this project, I've set some design requirements. This way, I will try to find the most efficient and cost-effective way possible of creating something that I'll be happy with:

## Design requirements
These are the absolute musts that a design should have:

- The rocket is powered by electric propulsion for cheap and safe flights and fast turnarounds
- The rocket uses thrust vectoring to lift off, hover and land propulsively
- The rocket can perform a 1 meter hop and hover for 30 seconds
- - The rocket is modular
	- Components are easily accessible and replaceable
	- The rocket is designed for a future launchpad integration
	  > If I achieve reliable landings, I might try to build a launchpad to launch and catch the rocket from. The rocket should be modular and be designed with this in mind.

		- The rocket has got detachable landing legs and attachable catch pins
		- The pad should be able to hold the rocket until full throttle is reached

## Dream goals
These are not essential but they'd be cool to have:

- The rocket can perform a 10 meter hop
- The rocket can hover for a minute
- The rocket looks as cool as possible
