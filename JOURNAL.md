## May 22: Goal of the project & Research on propulsion systems

I've identified the goal of this project to be the following:
> To learn, have fun and to make something that I'm proud of by building an electric model rocket capable of lifting off, hovering and landing propulsively.

With this goal in mind, I've brainstormed some concepts and I've chosen what I would want out of this project.

I've decided that the scope of this project should be building a fully reusable vehicle capable of lifting off, hovering and landing propulsively through thrust vector control. The rocket should be capable of  performing a 1 meter hop and hovering for 30 seconds.

Also, the rocket should be modular and allow for a future launchpad system. In the future, if I manage to reliably land the rocket I might attempt to build a launchpad to launch and catch the rocket from.

According to my vision of the project, I've set some design requirements. This way, I can try to find the cheapest and most efficient way possible of creating something that I'll be happy with. You can find those in Goal.md
