## Brainstorming reasons
- I want to make something I'm proud of
- I want to use my time in stuff that I actually like and I'm passionate about (i.e. to have fun)
- I want to come a bit closer to knowing if I want to pursue aerospace
- To learn PCB design, rocket design, control systems, avionics, project planning, CAD, software design, communications... for future projects

## THE GOAL
To learn, have fun and to build something that I'm proud of by building an electric model rocket capable of lifting off, hovering and landing propulsively.

### Objectives
- Learn avionics and PCB design
- Learn software, communication and control systems
- Learn rocket design
- Learn CAD and project planning

## Design requirements
- The rocket is powered by electric propulsion for cheap and safe flights and fast turnarounds
- The rocket uses thrust vectoring to lift off, hover and land propulsively
- The rocket can perform a 1 meter hop and hover for 30 seconds

### Dream goals
- The rocket can perform a 10 meter hop
- The rocket can hover for a minute
- The rocket is modular
	- Components are easily accessible and replaceable
	- The rocket is designed for a future launchpad integration
		- The rocket can either land on its legs or on the chopsticks
		- The rocket can perform a pad-aided liftoff
		- The rocket can be recharged and reflown autonomously
