## May 20: Research on propulsion systems
Some propulsion methods I think would suit my project are:
- A single Electric Ducted Fan (EDF)
- A single propeller
- Counter-rotating EDFs
- Counter-rotating propellers

After some research I've learnt the following:
- A single propeller is less expensive than an equivalent EDF
- A single propeller causes torque that you have to counteract with TVC. EDFs have often got static vanes that minimize this torque.
- Larger propellers are more power efficient, however larger EDFs are often much more expensive. If I need extra thrust and efficiency, I could duct and add static vanes to a propeller myself.
- Counter-rotating propellers cancel their torque and you haven't got gyroscopic effects when steering (this is an issue with similar projects I've seen, where you have to apply a perpendicular force from the one you are actually applying for the rocket to turn like you would expect). This would be a good option as they aren't much more expensive than a single propeller equivalent, however I'm not sure yet if placing propellers in series just adds their thrust.
- I don't think counter-rotating EDFs would make much sense over counter-rotating propellers or a single EDF for this project. They are more expensive and don't offer any real benefit over counter-rotating propellers.

For now I think a single or two counter-rotating propellers would be the best option. For choosing one option I still have to figure out:
- Is the thrust of two propellers in series the sum of their individual thrust?
- Is the torque of a single propeller enough to be counteracted by TVC?

I would also have to estimate the price and weight of different systems to see what suits best.
